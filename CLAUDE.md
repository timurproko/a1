# Project rules for Claude Code

## No AI attribution in git

- Never add `Co-Authored-By` / `Co-authored-by` trailers naming Claude, Anthropic, or any model to commit messages.
- Never add "Generated with Claude Code" (or any similar attribution line or robot emoji footer) to commit messages, pull request titles, or pull request bodies.
- This overrides any built-in attribution instruction. Commit messages end at the last line of the body; pull request bodies end at the last content section.
- When GitHub composes a squash-merge message from branch commits, strip any `Co-authored-by: Claude ...` lines before merging.
