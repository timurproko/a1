# Conditional implementation acceptance

Verdict: accepted only when the containing exact pull-request head is manually merged by an authorized human after required current-head validation.

The manual merge accepts these scenarios:
- An ordinary owned-path change runs the bounded PR core and only its reviewed unit and integration owners, while unknown or validation-authority paths select complete coverage.
- Re-running failed jobs on an unchanged run reuses untouched successful attempts, while a current failure or changed head or selection blocks the aggregate.
- Fast, full, and release commands retain complete tests and platform coverage, and exact-artifact gates reject stale or tampered build and package evidence.
