# Design

## Proposed by the sync, decided by a reviewer

The upgrade script bumps the pins, evaluates the candidate in isolation, three-way merges each vendored copy that follows upstream (old upstream, new upstream, A1 copy) and records the upstream delta of each copy A1 keeps, regenerates every derived artifact, and runs the gates. It never resolves a conflict, never drops an orphaned inventory entry, never records a feature disposition, and never merges; each of those is a review item in the pull-request body.
