# Conditional implementation acceptance

Verdict: accepted only when an authorized human directly merges the containing exact pull-request head after required current-head validation, explicitly asks the active agent to execute that protected exact-head merge while it is currently eligible, or personally enables native auto-merge for the unchanged head and GitHub integrates it after validation succeeds.

The maintainer integration decision accepts these scenarios:
- A newly requested Agent immediately shows one selected tab with an empty transcript, ruled prompt, visual caret, and both footer rows without loading text or child cursor.
- Closing that pending tab by shortcut or context menu immediately restores the previous Agent or landing without delivering the pending prompt to another tab.
- Cancellation skips a queued launch or stops an already registered Agent holder and child; late replies and registry updates reveal no ghost tab or close a subsequent Agent.
- A stopped Agent's late bridge request cannot detach the client while that Agent is still the server's viewed tab; the older Agent stays running.
- A later Agent opens normally with its own deferred input, and an existing Agent remains usable throughout cancellation.
- Every supported accent keeps its own visibly distinct pending and active chip shades without a blue-only color transition.
- The pending footer matches the real Agent's left and right gutters and available branch and pull-request display, while keeping new-tab usage at zero.
