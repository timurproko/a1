## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A changed setting applies to the running session
A1 SHALL apply a changed setting at the application boundary declared by its resolved entry and SHALL keep effective values consistent across every surface that reads them. Each presented setting SHALL declare one of `live`, `next-session`, `next-start`, or `current-exit`. A live setting SHALL take effect before the change reports success. A deferred setting SHALL state its boundary when changed rather than appearing live. A setting unavailable in the active product mode or environment SHALL be omitted from the settings UI without an unavailable placeholder row. These rules SHALL apply equally to A1 settings and settings supplied through the engine settings port.

#### Scenario: Change a live-applicable setting
- **WHEN** the user accepts a change to a setting declared as `live`
- **THEN** the new value SHALL take effect in the running session before success is reported
- **AND** every surface reading that setting SHALL observe the same effective value

#### Scenario: Change a restart-required setting
- **WHEN** the user accepts a change declared as `next-session`, `next-start`, or `current-exit`
- **THEN** the value SHALL be stored, the surface SHALL state the exact application boundary, and the running owner SHALL retain the previous value until that boundary

#### Scenario: Setting is unavailable
- **WHEN** the active product mode or environment cannot provide a setting's effect
- **THEN** the settings UI SHALL omit the entry and any option-specific unavailability text
- **AND** no hidden route SHALL accept a persisted no-op

#### Scenario: Applying a change fails
- **WHEN** storage accepts a value but its declared live effect fails
- **THEN** the screen SHALL report the failure, SHALL not claim the value is effective, and SHALL restore one consistent effective value

#### Scenario: Abandon a change
- **WHEN** the user cancels out of editing a setting before accepting it
- **THEN** no value SHALL be stored and the running session SHALL be unaffected

### Requirement: Resolved settings are offered to a surface as grouped sections
A1 SHALL expose the resolved settings as sections a consuming surface can present without knowing where a value is stored: the declared available A1 settings in their own section, and the available settings reported by the engine settings port under a distinct Agent section. Each presented entry SHALL carry its current stored value, current effective value when different, whether it can be changed from A1, its application boundary, its available choices where its source declares them, and its description where its source provides one. Agent settings SHALL be read, written, and applied only through the engine settings port; A1 SHALL NOT write Pi settings storage directly. Where the engine does not advertise the write or effect capability required by an entry, that entry SHALL be filtered from the presented section. A descriptor without an application contract SHALL not be promoted to a UI entry. The consuming surface SHALL retain the shared input, list, menu, dialog, shortcut, and scrollbar components and the reviewed semantic styles and geometry for setting rows, labels, values, selected state, controls, menus, structured dialogs, deferred and failure notices, wrapping, and narrow-terminal clipping. The owned settings interaction SHALL remain a declared product difference: descriptions stay in entry metadata but do not render as selected-row details; `/` alone opens search; search uses the shared ruled line-input composition; the standing status bar derives from active shortcut declarations; wheel distance resolves the effective live `scrollbarSpeed` through the shared scrollbar policy rather than a settings-screen literal; and scalar choices retain the shared `ValueMenu` while rendering as a visually distinct A1 floating panel.

#### Scenario: Build sections with an attached engine
- **WHEN** sections are built while the engine reports its settings
- **THEN** the A1 section SHALL list every declared setting with its resolved value, choices, description, source, and application boundary
- **AND** the Agent section SHALL list every available setting the engine reports with its stored and effective state, writability, and application boundary

#### Scenario: Present settings through the reviewed shared components
- **WHEN** the settings surface renders scalar, numeric, structured, selected, searched, deferred, failed, and narrow-width states
- **THEN** its rows, values, controls, menus, dialogs, notices, wrapping, and clipping SHALL preserve the reviewed shared-component terminal cells and semantic ANSI roles
- **AND** unavailable entries and their option-specific explanation SHALL remain absent
- **AND** no selected-entry description rows SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: Invoke settings search explicitly
- **WHEN** search is closed and the user enters ordinary printable text
- **THEN** the settings surface SHALL not open search or consume that text as a query
- **WHEN** the user enters `/`
- **THEN** the settings surface SHALL open the shared ruled line input with the `search settings` placeholder
- **AND** subsequent editing, navigation, cancellation, and filtering SHALL remain owned by that input until search closes

#### Scenario: Render settings status guidance
- **WHEN** no transient save result or interrupt warning replaces the standing settings status
- **THEN** the status bar SHALL render the applicable search, navigation, section-jump, change, adjustment, and cancel hints assembled from the active shortcut declarations
- **AND** it SHALL not advertise type-to-search behavior

#### Scenario: Scroll the settings list
- **WHEN** the user sends a wheel event over the settings list
- **THEN** movement SHALL resolve the currently effective `scrollbarSpeed`, including an accepted live value pending source reflection
- **AND** distance SHALL be obtained from the shared scrollbar policy with no independent settings-screen row-count literal

#### Scenario: Open a scalar setting menu
- **WHEN** the user opens the choices for a scalar setting
- **THEN** the menu SHALL retain shared `ValueMenu` placement, clipping, keyboard, and pointer behavior
- **AND** every choice SHALL render on A1's dark floating-panel background rather than blending into the settings rows
- **AND** the active choice SHALL render on A1's lighter panel background with white text
- **AND** the effective value SHALL carry a `✓` independently of the active choice

#### Scenario: Change a setting in the A1 section
- **WHEN** a change is accepted for an entry in the A1 section
- **THEN** the value SHALL be written to the A1 settings document, applied at its declared boundary, and SHALL NOT be sent to the engine settings port

#### Scenario: Change a setting in the Agent section
- **WHEN** a change is accepted for an entry in the Agent section and the engine advertises the required write and effect capability
- **THEN** the value SHALL be written and applied through the engine settings port, flushed where the engine advertises flush capability, and SHALL NOT be written into the A1 settings document

#### Scenario: Engine advertises no settings write capability
- **WHEN** the engine settings port reports no write capability for its settings
- **THEN** those Agent entries SHALL be omitted from the settings UI
- **AND** an attempted change through any stale or hidden route SHALL be refused rather than silently dropped

#### Scenario: Engine advertises storage without an effect
- **WHEN** an engine descriptor can be persisted but has no application contract for the active mode
- **THEN** the Agent entry and its missing-effect explanation SHALL be omitted from the settings UI

#### Scenario: Agent settings cannot be read
- **WHEN** the engine settings port fails, reports no settings, or is absent
- **THEN** the A1 section SHALL still be complete and usable
- **AND** no stale, invented, or unavailable-placeholder Agent entry SHALL appear

#### Scenario: Report a failed change
- **WHEN** a change cannot be stored or cannot be applied through the engine
- **THEN** the failure SHALL be reported to the caller and the change SHALL NOT be reported as effective
