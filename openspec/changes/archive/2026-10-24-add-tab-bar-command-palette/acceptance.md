# Conditional implementation acceptance

Verdict: accepted only when an authorized human directly merges the containing exact pull-request head after required current-head validation, explicitly asks the active agent to execute that protected exact-head merge while it is currently eligible, or personally enables native auto-merge for the unchanged head and GitHub integrates it after validation succeeds.

The maintainer integration decision accepts these scenarios:
- Clicking `+` with the default plus menu adds an Agent at once, without a menu.
- Right-clicking `+` shows `Configure`, which opens the `Plus Menu` modal over the current tab listing Settings; `Space` toggles it, and `+` then opens a menu with Agent and Settings.
- Settings shows a `Tab Bar` section whose `Plus menu` entry opens the same `Plus Menu` modal.
- `Alt+/` dims the frame and opens a palette of Agent, Settings, and Changelog; typing filters, arrows move, `Enter` opens, `Esc` closes, and the mouse does nothing.
- Choosing Changelog from the palette opens one `Changelog` tab at once that `Esc` does not close, and resident Agents no longer offer `/changelog`.
- The tab rename selection shows a blue background with unchanged text color.
- `/name` in an Agent renames its tab, and renaming the tab renames the session.
