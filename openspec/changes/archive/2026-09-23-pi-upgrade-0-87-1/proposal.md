## Why

Pi 0.87.1 is published and A1 pins 0.87.0. The nightly upstream sync proposed this upgrade with every derived artifact refreshed so the reviewer evaluates a diff, not a migration.

## What Changes

- Pin `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and `@earendil-works/pi-tui` at 0.87.1 (upstream commit f07218c4d4bbc12bef056a7058c3dd49dfe41abe).
- Re-merge the vendored copies that follow upstream with A1's recorded deviations, regenerate the source ledger and provenance headers, re-resolve the inventories, refresh the public API and feature adoption baselines, and refresh parity evidence.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `owned-pi-ui-foundation`: the pinned Pi identity moves to 0.87.1.

## Impact

Recorded in the pull-request body: merge conflicts, kept copies with an upstream delta, orphaned or unmapped inventory entries, public API adoption items, pending feature rows, and failed or blocked gates are the review items; user-visible Pi behavior changes go to the changelog's breaking-changes section when this merges.
